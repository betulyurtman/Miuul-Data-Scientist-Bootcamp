# Miuul-Data-Scientist-Bootcamp

Miuul Data Scientist Bootcamp is a 4 month bootcamp that includes the following modules:

1) Python Programming for Data Science
2) CRM Analytics
3) Measurement Problems
4) Recommendation Systems
5) Feature Engineering
6) Machine Learning
7) Querying MS SQL

During this time, we completed these online courses and had team meeting, mentor meeting and a recap meeting with our teacher Vahit Keskin every week.

These courses were prepared according to the industry needs so they were both theoretical and practical.

We completed projects every week for each module and worked on datasets from Armut, FLO, Amazon and more.

At the end of the modules, we completed a project.

My project was named "Book a Movie" and the subject was recommending books and movies with content based recommendation algorithm.
